          <h3>The SE4All Agenda</h3>
          <p>The key objectives of the <a href="https://www.seforall.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">SE4ALL initiative</a> globally are to ensure universal access to modern energy services; doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency; and doubling the share of renewable energy in global energy mix
            by 2030 compared to 2010. </p>
           <p>  These objectives are premised around the proposition that national governments must design and implement a set of integrated country actions to drive transformative change of the world's energy systems; create
            the right investment environment for the private sector's participation; and the interplay of civil society organizations in identifying, advocating, and monitoring public policy and business action; mobilising social innovation and
            grassroots action; leading behavioural change; and helping to spread best practices and building capacity at all levels in partnership with governments and businesses</p>

            Nigeria's SE4All Action Agenda takes a leading role in supporting the implementation of SDG goals in particular SDG7 in the country, and to monitor and report on progress towards the Goal.

              Through this tool the Nigerian government has
            demonstrated its commitment in achieving the 3 objectives of the global SE4ALL initiative. The Nigerian power sector has just gone through a transition phase from being publicly owned and controlled to a decentralised private sector
            driven one. The process was adjudged as one of the most ambitious and transparent processes in the continent. Prior to this, the Nigerian Government had demonstrated the commitment to the Initiative by launching the SE4ALL Nigeria in the
              year 2012. <b>This singular act placed Nigeria as one of the first Nations in the world to embrace this initiative.</b> Thus, objectives of the SE4ALL initiative is in tandem with the goals of the national energy agenda, which gives high
            priority to providing access to safe, reliable and affordable energy to citizens in both urban and rural areas. The SE4All initiative requires countries to set quantitative objectives for each of the three goals described in SE4ALL Global
            Action Agenda 2012. Nigeria's SE4All objectives are therefore defined as follows:</p>

                <li>For high-energy consuming sectors (transport, power and industrial sectors), efficient energy technologies will be progressively introduced as well as other demand side management measures such as peak load management when
                  possible. Compared with the current 2015 level, energy efficiency will increase by at least 20% by 2020 and 50% by 2030</li>

                <li>To achieve maintain a 2% contribution of wind energy to the nation's electricity generation mix by 2020 and 2030 respectively</li>
                <li>To achieve a 20% and 19% contribution of solar energy (PV and Solar thermal) to the nation's electricity generation mix by 2020 and 2030 respectively</li>
                <li>To achieve and maintain a 3% power generation capacity using biomass resource by 2020 and 2030, respectively</li>
                <li>To achieve 10% biofuel blends by 2020 using locally produced renewable biofuel from secondary biomass</li>
